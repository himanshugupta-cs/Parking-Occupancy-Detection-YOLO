##  Project Overview
SmartParkAI is a computer vision-based solution designed to automate parking lot management. By leveraging the **YOLOv8** architecture, the system identifies "empty" and "occupied" parking slots in real-time. This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI workflow, from dataset integration to model training and inference.

## Key Features
* **Real-Time Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8n (Nano) for high-speed inference.
* **Dual-Class Classification:** Specifically trained to distinguish between `empty` and `occupied` spaces.
* **Cloud-Integrated Workflow:** Seamlessly connects with **Roboflow** for dataset management and **Google Colab** for GPU-accelerated training.

## Tech Stack
* **Model Architecture:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
* **Environment:** Google Colab (Tesla T4 GPU)
* **Libraries:** `ultralytics`, `opencv-python`, `roboflow`

## Collaboration & Attribution
* **Model Training & Development:** Himanshu Gupta
* **Dataset Credits:** Himanshu Gupta & Arnav Jain
